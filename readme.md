# NaNoWriMo 2017 (Video Game Crossover Fanfic)

## Plot

Sam has been possessed by Azazel who has been sending Demons through to other realms.  Dean and Cass track Sam's demon invested body to New York City by following the grisly trail of bodies while Alec and Magnus portal in from another realm trying to hunt down the demon who is keeping the Shadowhunters more than busy.  Nox is alerted to unfamiliar magic through his otherworldly connections and leaves a family gathering so he can deal with the crimes at hand.  The three parties clash in an abandond subway tunnel.
