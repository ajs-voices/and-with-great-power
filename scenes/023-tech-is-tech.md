# Tech is Tech

Alec and Magnus had shared a sweet kiss good-bye and Dean asked, “Hey, where’s mine?” Magnus had chuckled and Alec blushed. If it had been Dev or Nox kissing like that, well they wouldn’t have been sweet, it would have been full on passion - it always was. But if they had been kissing and Dean asked. One or both of them would have tries to place a kiss on those plump lips of his. Fuck! I was grateful to be moving away from him and those thoughts.

There was a purple portal standing before us and Alec took my elbow and we walked through. Both of us blushing furiously.

When we walked out we were inside my basement apartment just missing the couch separating the kitchenette from the ‘living room’. The portal closed behind us and Alec stepped around towards the computer. He set the device down on the computer and took a seat where Adam usually sat. “I miss our touch screens.”

I sighed. “I wish I had them. If I did Nox would be in heaven. He could actually do more that way.”

“He doesn’t use computers?” Alec asked.

“He does. He’s just a user though, he does even less with them now that I do it all for him. But he has his things he must do himself.” I sighed. Nox always had issues - he had issues with just about everything.

“You seem fustrated with him.” Alec observed.

I sat down at my computer and let my power go. I make sure I knew I had Nox’s power under control. My vision blurred a little while I got things settled. But it wasn’t so hard, keeping that tight control. Nox didn’t have accidental fires. It took him years to gain control. Or had it?

Garrett had beaten him, that would be incentive enough for me to do what I had to do quickly, but once he learned the beating kept happening. Nox had mentioned a year and more. He was 6 when he stopped training with Garrett.

Alec touched my elbow, “You okay?”

I nodded. “Yeah. I was just thinking how frustrating Nox was.” I grinned at him.

“Jace is always rushing around getting in to trouble and I have to bail him out. And then he met Clary and our lives all turned upside down. Now, I’m living with a warlock, working with werewolves and vampires to make a better world for my kids and everyone else’s.”

“Nox doesn’t get into trouble. He attracts it. He hunts trouble that’s the problem. I really don’t see why he can’t just be happy living with me and the boys.”

Alec frowned but I turned away. I didn’t want to see the disappointment in his fact just like in everyone else’s when I said that. I was suppose to be supportive, but I didn’t want to lose Nox. And fighting vampires and demons and things was just going to get him killed. I don’t think I could handle that. So I ignored it and I started working.

The device was weird. It didn’t have any gears or switches, much less anything else I recognized. But I felt it humming with energy and I knew it was tech - just not something I had ever seen before.

I let my gift flow through the device I took a panel off and Alec hummed softly to himself. I wasn’t sure if he was making notes or proud I had figured something out on my own. I hooked up leads from his device to my computer. I didn’t know if it was digital or analog in signal but it didn’t matter the converter would either work or not so then I’d have an answer.

The problem was it wasn’t reading anything so I couldn’t even tell if there was a data stream. I asked, “How does this work?”

Alec picked it up. “I’ll have to operate the box, while you do the rest, it uses angelic powers.”

I chuckled to myself. “Yeah I don’t know how to recreate that. Guess you are stuck holding the box while it works.”

Alec leaned back in his chair with the box in his hand and smiled. “That’s why I’m here.”

“Cass could have done this.” I said.

Alec raised an eyebrow. “You’d rather spend time with him? Than with me? I find that shocking.”

I blushed but I also grinned at him. “If I were Nox I’d have a smart comeback to say. And if I were Dev I’d have a perfect quote from some movie or song sitting on the tip of my tongue. I’m surprised I got that out of my mouth.”

“I make you tongue-tied?” It was Alec’s turn to blush.

“Let’s just say we match color for color on it all.”

Alec laughed and nodded. “I bet Nox and Dev make you blush on purpose.”

“Dee too.”

Alec shook his head. “I don’t know how you do it? Two boyfriends **and** a girlfriend. With three boys, two of them who are only a few years younger right?”

I nodded. “They are both sixteen. But they adore Nox.”

“Sure it’s not a crush?” Alec asked.

“Yeah, we are. Dev would let us know if Matt’s feelings changed.”

We sat in silence for a the next few minutes while I typed furiously on the keyboard. My gift was doing it’s thing and I was telling the computer what to do that my gift couldn’t do. It was unique and fun to watch. Jack and Adam didn’t do it quite the same way. Jack said that no one works exactly the same way and our powers are much the same. It’s not one set prescribed method, we all figure it out as we go and learn different tricks. But the two different techs were working well together. I just had to hook it up into the police system and map it all out and get real time data. It wasn’t difficult to do, just time consuming.
