# Castiel

Dean jumped, “Cass, what have I told you about doing that?”

Cass looked at him with innocence, “To not do that.”

I giggled, “You sound like my 3 year old when I tell him not to do that. Can I ask him why he did that?”

Dean glared at me. “Shut your…”

I interrupted, “Cake hole, yeah I got the that the first time. But why is your Angel bodyguard here?”

Castiel turned his level gaze at me and then took a step closer and peered into my soul, my eyes, my very life and asked, “What is he?”

“He don’t know.” Dean said. “I ain’t ever seen something like it. Have you?” He asked Cass.

The angel shook his head. “Never.” He walked around me like I was some sort of statue.

“I’m just a human.”

Cass gave a curt laugh. “Not with power like that.”

“Venatori?” I asked.

Dean sounded skeptical, “What’s that?”

“Uh, a magical being who is mostly human but has special properties, some of them can do elemental magic.”

“Never heard of it.” The both said in unison.

“Jinx.” Cass yelled out happily.

Dean glared at him, “Maybe he is three.” He said looking at me.

“So you don’t know what you are?” His voice was deep and I think he was trying to threaten me a little.

I shrugged. I didn’t want to tell him it was a dream, it might shatter it. So play along I did. “I think I’ve swapped powers with my boyfriend.”

Dean looked at me and then took a step back with a big smile. I rolled my eyes, “I have two boyfriends and a girlfriend if you want to get all weirded out by things.” I turned around and started for Bonnie’s. It wasn’t far from here. “I know a place that has a great pumpkin pie and pancakes.”

Dean fell into step next to me, “Did you say pancakes?”

I nodded, “I did.”

Cass stayed where we were standing and called out after us. “You trust this Venatori?”

Dean and I stopped and turned to look back at Cass. Dean shrugged. “He can throw fireballs out of his hands. He hasn’t killed me yet, so I’m thinking I’m safe.” We stood there staring at Cass, but we didn’t get a chance to do much before a large purple circle opened up in the middle of the greenway just beyond Cass. We stood their staring as a scorpion like creature skittered through and tried to run away from two shadowed figures that walked through the purple portal in the sky.

I looked around looking for another portal, had my dream just turned into a video game?
