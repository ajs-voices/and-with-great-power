# Running Away

I ran until my legs couldn’t carry me anymore. I sat down on the stoop of some house in Harlem. It would be dangerous if it wasn’t a dream. But I knew I’d be fine. But that man …

I had killed him.

I hadn’t been sitting long when Mr Tall and always right stepped out of the shadows and sat down next to me. “Accidents happen.” He said.

“Not to me they don’t.” I said. “I don’t have accidents. I don’t do anything where an accident can happen. Everything is very deliberate. Every piece of code I write has a purpose. Everything I do has a purpose even if it’s just to have fun. I don’t do accidents.”

Alec laughed, “There are always accidents. You can’t tell me you haven’t fallen down the stairs, said something someone took the wrong way.” Alec watched my reaction and stopped there when I was blushing. “See. You do things by accident. You didn’t mean to.”

He clashed his hands together and hung his head, “I remember the first time I killed a mundane. It was an accident. There was a crowd of people, a demon through Jace into me and I let lose an arrow in the fall. My finger had just slipped. It shot into the nearest window and killed a woman who was feeding her baby while watching the street below. “

“What did you do?” I asked.

“Me, I didn’t do anything. Jace with his level head cleaned up my mess. My accident never made the books. The woman looked like she died of natural causes.”

“But she had an arrow….”

Alec nodded. “Part of the magic of our world, we can cover up a lot of things, and with the right cop in the know it’s easy. I’m sure your Nox does the same thing. I’m sure he’s killed by accident as well. It happens when we first do this, when we are young and still learning.”

I shook my head, “Nox doesn’t kill anything, that’s kinda his thing.”

Alec smiled. “He hunts things that want to kill him, I’m sure he’s killed to save his life.”

I nodded, “Shortly after I first met him he killed a man - a dragon actually - with his gift, he was dead on his feet afterwards, but after a nap he was back to working.”

“I think I’d like him.” Alec said.

“You probably would.” I nodded. “I don’t know if I can do this.”

Alec put his hand on my shoulder and squeezed. “You can. You will. It’s the right thing to do. We need your help. You got us this far. Why not help us find Azazel and let’s send him back to the hell dimension he belongs.”
