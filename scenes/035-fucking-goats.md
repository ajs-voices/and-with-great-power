# Fucking Goats

Dean and Castiel weren’t gone for long. Just long enough to take the Impala to some place out in Queens that sold goats. They weren't skinny little things like I expected. No they were fat and well feed and looked as healthy as ever. And they were raised for the sole purpose of sacrifice. How many fucking goat sacrifices are there that there is an entire business that caters to selling goats for sacrifice. WHAT the fuck!

Dean carried one goat. Cass the other and it looked liked some farm hands I’d seen out in the Hamptons when I was a kid. God we hadn’t been out there in years. Carla and I had out grown the family trips in our teenage years and now Danny and Rosie didn’t take any trips that weren’t pack related. I sighed at the memories as Dean and Cass set down the bleating goats in my spare room in the basement. “They’ll be fine for a little while.” Dean had said when I protested they were going to ruin things.

Dean and Alec moved the furniture of my basement to make room for the summoning spell. I was thinking the whole time why are we summoning a demon to my basement? Why can’t we go someplace else? Then I asked like where? I didn’t even think to watch Alec or Dean or both as they lifted heavy objects. I was so lost in my thoughts and when Magnus pointed out Alec’s buldging muscles as he lifted the couch I chided myself. Magnus chuckled. “Pay attention to the finer things. Don’t worry about the mess. There will always be a mess.”

I wasn’t sure Magnus was talking about the mess that was about to become my basement floor. I think he meant my life. Or Nox’s life. Was that how it was with every hero. And I thought about it knew it was the case. Lois Lane always sacrificed her love of superman for his love of saving people. MJ for Spider-man. Every superhero ever sucked at relationships. Even Harry Potter did. That wasn’t why my boyfriend sucked at relationships, but it didn’t help matters any. And all in all Nox was a great partner. He was loving and kind he understood me. He let me get away with things others had looked down on me about. He was not perfect. I was far from it myself. Why should I expect him to change? He never asked me to…

I sighed as Dean rolled up the carpet on my floor. All bent over like that I was glad this was a dream and no one noticed how fucking hot for him I was. I had to turn away and decided to go get the stupid ass goats in the spare room. And I was right. The fucking goats trashed the room. They ate the bed spread and the carpet. There were bear spots on the floor, holes in the blankets and one of the video games that had gotten left in her was devoured. I picked up the mangled box and stomped out of the room and tossed it at Dean. “They’ll be fine you said!” I growled.

Dean reached for his gun like I was a threat. But he didn’t draw it. “I’m not a fucking werewolf.”

Dean shook himself and put his hands back in front of him and nodded. “Coulda fooled me.”

I grinned at him. “Years of standing up to them. What can I say.” I wasn’t very good at standing up to the other kids in the pack when I was younger, it wasn’t until Nox that I had that courage. I was still only human, but when you have a partner like Nox you have so much more power. No one would mess with me now.

The goats were running around my office space now. Not running, they were grazing - eating the fucking carpet! I was almost thankful they were going to die right now. 

Magnus grumbled as he drew a pentagram on the ground with chalk. “Blood magic…” He shuddered but kept drawing.

Alec watched. Dean and Cass were chasing the goats and I was going to be pissed if they ate my computer cables or worse yet broke one. Dream or no dream I would fireball his ass if it happened.
