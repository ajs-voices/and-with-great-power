# Kinks

I watched Alec and Magnus a little while longer before I stomped up the stairs so they’d hear me coming. They weren’t my lovers and they’d probably be pretty pissed off if they knew what I’d been doing. I was used to covering my tracks. I shut down everything on my computer before leaving it out of habit. I didn’t want my dad seeing some of the things I did. And I didn’t want Nox to see it. It wasn’t that he didn’t know. It’s just out of sight out of mind. And I definitely didn’t want Drake to walk in and see it. Or Matt and Fae, but they already knew about a few kinks.

We were careful to make sure the boys weren’t around, but once and a while they were.

I sighed as I pushed open the basement door and headed for the kitchen. The door swung open and Magnus was chuckling. “Something upsetting? Or were you letting us know you were coming.”

I could feel the heat rising at the back of my neck. “Both.” I muttered.

“Alec does the same thing when he nears Jace’s or Izzy’s room.” Magnus grinned at his boyfriend, “It’s rather endearing.”

Alec defended himself, “I’ve walked in on them one too many times.”

“Normally I don’t mind walking in on things.” I said as I opened the fridge to get a bottle of water.

Magnus’ chuckling grew louder. “I thought there was a camera in here.”

I bit back the groan of disapproval and I knew that I was a pretty shade of red. I cracked the lid on my water bottle and was pulling a long swig from it. Alec was blushing furiously too. Magnus was laughing.

Alec grumbled, “It’s not funny.”

I sat down at the island and new I was still blushing. “It was hot.” I said without skipping a beat and Alec’s blush grew deeper. But he looked proud.

Magnus asked, “Do your partners know?”

I nodded quickly. “Yes. I’m not allowed to record without their knowledge.” I could see Alec fidgeting more than before so I added, “I didn’t record you guys either.” It was a dream I couldn’t anyway but I didn’t say that out loud.

Magnus elbowed Alec, “See not everyone is just plain vanilla.”

“I don’t want to talk about this.” Alec muttered as he walked across the room to fiddle with something on the counter.

I chuckled. “It’s a good thing Nox isn’t here, or Dev. They’d tease you until you caved and were spilling your kinks to them.”

“I don’t have any kinks.” Alec spit out.

Magnus was laughing. "That’s a like Alexander.” Magnus said, which earned him a sharp glare from his blue-eyed beau.

“We don’t have to talk about it. I’d rather not too.” I said and watched Alec visibly relax. I changed the subject, “How’s your end of things going?”

Magnus smiled. “Waiting on Dean and Castiel to bring the other ingredients.”

The kitchen door swung open. “We got the ingredients,” Castiel intoned.

But when Dean walked through he had a split lip. Cass added, “There was a little trouble.”
