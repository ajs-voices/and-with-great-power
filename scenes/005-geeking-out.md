# Geeking Out

Dee and I went out on a date, just the two of us. It was sweet and fun and we forgot all about our problems. Until we got home to find Dev curled up on the couch watching Supernatural. It was the first season episode 1. Damn they looked young back then. Dev looked up at me. “I’m watching Supernatural, you want to join me?”

Dee groaned and sat down in the recliner with a book. My book, no that was Nox’s book. The City of Bones - book 1 of the Immortal Instruments. I’d just finished it a few days ago. I had the second one up by my bed. They weren’t Nox’s favorite books, but he’d read them so i figured what the hell. And he’d been right it was a good book. I didn’t read as much as he did, but that was starting to change with him always around. But he wasn’t going to be I said to myself you threw him out.

I sighed and Dev sat up and patted the couch next to him. I sat down and he laid down in my lap. His dark hair splayed across my leg and his head laying just right so that he was displaying his neck. I ran my fingers down his neck and a smile spread over his face. He whispered, “Everything will be all right.” So the three of us watched Supernatural until the wee ours of the night.

We were drained, Dev took Dee home. I had suggested they stay but they had work early and didn’t want to wake me. Dev said he had a gig in the Hamptons and had to get out there early to set up. I didn’t think anything of it as I made my way to bed. The house was empty and quiet and it all felt so strange. I sighed as I crawled into my bed with just my boxers on - alone. I laid down and tried to fall asleep but it wasn’t going to happen so I flipped the light on by the side of my bed and picked up my book. I’d read until I fell asleep.
