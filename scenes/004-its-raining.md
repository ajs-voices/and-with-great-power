# It's Raining

I opened my eyes and I was standing in a green pasture staring at an old gnarled tree. The stars were shining and the sun was out. I’d been here once before. But this time it was raining. I looked up and there were no clouds in the weird sky, but it rained.

Dee was next to me and so was Dev. Nox was curled up in front of the tree and he looked like he was having a panic attack. I glared at Dev. “We were going out.”

Dev smiled at me, “You can go out after you talk to him.”

Now I was not only made at Nox but peeved at Dev for bringing us here without our permission. I was still wondering how that had happened. I hadn’t agreed to it, neither had Dee.

Our conversation passed in flits and sputters like a dream. I woke not really remembering what it was, but I felt damp and drained and Dev was still sleeping. Dee was looking at me and asked, “Why was it raining?”

I shrugged. “I don’t know. You ready to go?” I didn’t really remember why I was upset with Dev but I didn’t suggest we wake him up. The only thing I knew was Dev had ticked me off.
